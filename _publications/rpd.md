permalink: /publication/wip3
excerpt: 'This is a continuation of the work in Strategic evolution in sequential games. Compared to simple sequential games like the Ultimatum Game, repeated games are the next step up in complexity --- they have much more decisions compared to the former, but these decisions are much more well-structured compared to general sequential games like chess or Go. This project looks at different categorizations of normal-form strategies in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma using various notions of complexity from the automaton literature and information theory.'
